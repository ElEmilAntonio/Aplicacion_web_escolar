    Un agitador es un instrumento usado en los laboratorios de química que consiste en una varilla, regularmente de vidrio, que sirve para mezclar o revolver por medio de la agitación de algunas sustancias.
  <P></P>
También sirve para introducir sustancias líquidas de alta reacción por medio de escurrimiento y evitar accidentes. Existen diferentes tipos de agitadores dependiendo de la aplicación pueden ser con parrilla o simples, y de diferentes velocidades.
   <p></p>
Se usan para los líquidos de baja densidad y sólidos de baja densidad.
